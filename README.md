# 👋 WELCOME TO MY PROFILE👋

## 💻 Blockchain Developer | Smart Contract Engineer | Full Stack Web3 Innovator

As a blockchain developer with deep experience in decentralized applications, DeFi systems, and NFTs, I specialize in designing, auditing, and deploying secure smart contracts for EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BSC, and beyond. My commitment is to pushing the boundaries of Web3 by building reliable, scalable, and highly performant blockchain applications.



### 🛠 Core Technical Expertise

- **Smart Contracts & Protocol Development**: Proficient in Solidity and Rust with extensive experience in building and optimizing smart contracts for DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, and Layer 2 scaling solutions.
- **Blockchain Ecosystems**: Expertise in Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos, with contributions across different consensus algorithms and decentralized storage solutions.
- **Security & Auditing**: Skilled in secure coding practices and auditing with tools like Slither and MythX, implementing best practices to prevent re-entrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and other common vulnerabilities.
- **Front-End**: Developing dApp interfaces with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and integrating Web3 technologies using libraries like ethers.js, web3.js, and wagmi for seamless wallet connections and data retrieval.
- **Back-End & API Development**: Building robust server-side applications in Node.js and Express.js with a focus on scalability, microservices architecture, and RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
